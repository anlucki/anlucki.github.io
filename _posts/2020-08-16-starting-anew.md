For me every <em>new</em> project has, on one hand, the excitement brought by those things that are new (revisiting old skills, learning new ones, the thrill of making new definitions, etc); yet, on the other hand, it has that intimidating and overwhelming sense of white, empty, blank slate.

This is not the first time I embark on a project of maintaining a blog and, being completely honest... between work, college, socializing (<em>what the quarantine permits, anyway</em>), I fear this will end up like most times before: in memory lane. However, I think the main difference between <em>most times before</em> and now is: <strong>purpose</strong> and <strong>intent</strong>.

Last year has been, for me, transformative. A conjunction of events that lead me to go above and beyond my comfort zone. A journey of reinventing myself, discovering new things, and exploring new ways to work with myself and others both professionally and at a personal level.

In that journey I stumbled a few times with the (<em>odd?</em>) <strong>urgency</strong> of communicating with others and sharing beyond my regular circle. The compelling feeling of opening the discussion, mixed with a need for reaching out and exchange new ideas: finding new <em>meanings</em>.

> Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times.<br/>

That being said, thanks for reading this "initial commit". I hope for more to come! :)
