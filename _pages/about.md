Hi, my name is Ariel Lucki. I'm a developer based in Buenos Aires. I specialize in back-end development and some bits of front-end and devops here and there. I'm currently working as a tech lead with a small but awesome team, although I dabbled in several roles during my career.

Thanks for visiting! There's not much content at the moment, but a few ideas in progress! Please check again later for more! ;)
